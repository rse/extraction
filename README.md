About
-----

Extraction is a very small JavaScript library... FIXME

Installation
------------

#### Node environments (with NPM package manager):

```shell
$ npm install extraction
```

#### Browser environments (with Bower package manager):

```shell
$ bower install extraction
```

Usage
-----

```
extraction.extract(graph: object, spec: string, options?: object): object
```

```
extraction.reify(tree: object, options?: object): object
```

Implementation Notice
---------------------

Although the Extraction library is written in ECMAScript 6, it is
transpiled to ECMAScript 5 and this way runs in really all(!) current
(as of 2015) JavaScript environments, of course.
